This project is a simple yet powerful Web Crawler built in Go. It recursively explores websites, retrieves HTML content, and avoids infinite loops by tracking visited URLs. The crawler handles URL parsing, respects domain boundaries, and performs concurrent network requests using Go’s goroutines and channels. It’s an excellent project to learn about concurrency, recursion, and efficient web scraping techniques in Go. Customize the crawler to filter by domain, depth, or content type. Just run the program with a starting URL, and it will map out linked pages while managing performance and avoiding redundant requests.
